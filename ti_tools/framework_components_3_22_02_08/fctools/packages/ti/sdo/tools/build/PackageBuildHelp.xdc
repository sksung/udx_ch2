 *  Common package build support

 *  (`package.bld`). It provides a high-level interface for defining
 *  your libraries and executables, and provides functions to generate
 *  your package interface (makefiles).

     *  ======== LibAttrs ========
     *  Attributes for a library instances
     *
     *  An array of this type is passed to `PackageBuildHelp.makeLibraries`.
     *  Each element in the array describes the build properties for the
     *  library. Multiple library instances may be produced from a single
     *  `LibAttrs` element. For example, a library instance may be build for
     *  different profiles and/or different targets.
     *
     *  The `icw` array is used to limit which targets will be use for
     *  building the library. For example, if you have a library which
     *  should only be built for ARM, but you know the build model has a
     *  target for DSP, then set the `icw` array as follows to build only
     *  for the ARM targets and exclude the DSP targets.
     *
     *  @p(code)
     *  icw: [ "v5T" ]
     *  @p(text)
     *  Note that all ARM targets which accept v5T as an input isa will
     *  build the library using their output isa. For example, if the build
     *  model contains both GCArmv5T (isa=v5T) and GCArmv6 (isa=v6) targets,
     *  then both targets will build this library using their respective
     *  isa. However, if the build model contains the C64P (isa=64P) target,
     *  it will not be used to build this library because it cannot accept
     *  the v5T isa.
     *
     *  @a(See Also)
     *  {@link #makeLibraries} -- for additional examples
     *
     *  @field(name) The name of the library with an optional
     *  directory prefix.
     *
     *  @field(sources) An array of source files to be compiled
     *  for the library.
     *
     *  @field(icw) An array of strings listing isa's that a given target
     *  must be able to accept. Use this property to limit which targets
     *  will be used to build this library. See Details below.
     *

     *  ======== ProgAttrs ========
     *  Attributes for an executable instance
     *
     *  An array of this type is passed to `PackageBuildHelp.makeExecutables`.
     *  Each element in the array describes the build properties for the
     *  executable. Multiple executable instances may be produced from a
     *  single `ProgAttrs` element. For example, an executable instance may
     *  be build for different profiles, targets, and platforms.
     *
     *  The `icw` array is used to limit which targets will be use for
     *  building the executable. For example, if you have an executable
     *  which should only be built for ARM, but you know the build model
     *  has a target for DSP, then set the `icw` array as follows to build
     *  only for the ARM targets and exclude the DSP targets.
     *

     *  icw: [ "v5T" ]
     *  @p(text)
     *  Note that all ARM targets which accept v5T as an input isa will
     *  build the executable using their output isa. For example, if the build
     *  model contains both GCArmv5T (isa=v5T) and GCArmv6 (isa=v6) targets,
     *  then both targets will build this executable using their respective
     *  isa. However, if the build model contains the C64P (isa=64P) target,
     *  it will not be used to build this executable because it cannot accept
     *  the v5T isa.
     *
     *  @p(text)
     *  Note: this property is more useful to building libraries than
     *  executables. The `isas` property is usually used when building
     *  executables.
     *
     *  @p(text)
     *  The `isas` array is used to control the executable's isa. Only those
     *  targets which have an output isa that matches any entry in this array
     *  will be used to build the executable. For example, if you have a
     *  program which should be built for ARM v5T or ARM v6 but not for ARM
     *  v7A, but you know the build model has targets for all three, then
     *  set the `isas` array as follows to get the desired output.
     *
     *  @p(code)
     *  isas: [ "v5T", "v6" ]
     *  @p(text)
     *  Note: although the GCArmv7A target accepts v5T and v6 isa as input,
     *  it will not participate in the build because it outputs v7A isa which
     *  not specified in the `isas` array.
     *
     *  @a(See Also)
     *  {@link #makeExecutables} -- for additional examples
     *
     *  @field(name) The name of the executable with an optional
     *  directory prefix.
     *
     *  @field(sources) An array of strings listing the source files
     *  to be compiled for the executables.
     *
     *  @field(platforms) An array of platform (and/or platform instance)
     *  names which are supported by this program. When this property is
     *  specified, the executable is built only for those platforms listed
     *  by this property, otherwise, the executable is built for all
     *  platforms specified in the target's platforms array property.
     *
     *  @field(icw) An array of strings listing isa's which are compatible
     *  for this executable. Use this property to limit which isa's the
     *  program will be built for.
     *
     *  @field(isas) An array of isa's the program should be built for.
     *
     *  @field(execAttrs) An xdc.bld.Executable.Attrs object used to specify
     *  optional attributes of the executable instance.
