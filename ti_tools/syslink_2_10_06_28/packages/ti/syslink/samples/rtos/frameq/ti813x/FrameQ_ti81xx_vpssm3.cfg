 * Conditionally add support for TILER FrameQ Bufs via a remote
 * tiler allocator.  Note that this increases the complexity of the
 * system as tiler requests are satisfied by a daemon running on another
 * processer - typically the host.  Also the properties of the host must
 * match the TilerSettings.tilerDaemonName and TilerSettings.heapId values.
 *
 * Note that the SysLink rtos libraries will need to be built with an
 * additional -DSYSLINK_USE_TILER flag (typically set in _config.bld).
 *
 * Also note that adding this feature introduces a dependency on the Tiler
 * allocator, currently a part of the Framework Components product.
 * Makefiles will need updated to add that product to the XDCPATH when
 * building SysLink as well as when building this example executable.
